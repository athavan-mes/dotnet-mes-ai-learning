# README.md

C# was created by Microsoft.

👤 Main creator

	Anders Hejlsberg
	(also the creator of Turbo Pascal and TypeScript)

🏢 Organization

	Microsoft

📅 Timeline

	Started: around 1999

	First released: 2000

	Introduced as part of .NET Framework

🎯 Why C# was created

	Microsoft wanted:

		A modern, object-oriented language

		Safer than C++

		More powerful than Visual Basic

		Strongly typed, garbage-collected

		Perfect for Windows and enterprise systems

🧠 Design influences

	C# was influenced by:

	C++ → syntax & performance ideas

	Java → OOP model & garbage collection

	Delphi → productivity (from Anders Hejlsberg)

# 📘 C# vs Java vs C++ — Complete Comparison

This README provides a **clear, practical comparison** of **C#, Java, and C++**, focusing on **OOP concepts, performance, memory management, and real-world use cases**.

## 🔹 1. Language Philosophy

| Feature | C# | Java | C++ |
|------|----|------|-----|
| Language type | Modern OOP + productivity | Pure OOP | Multi-paradigm |
| Paradigm | OOP, Functional | OOP | Procedural + OOP |
| Complexity | Medium | Medium | High |
| Learning curve | Easy → Medium | Easy → Medium | Hard |

---

## 🔹 2. Compilation & Execution

| Feature | C# | Java | C++ |
|------|----|------|-----|
| Compiles to | IL (Intermediate Language) | Bytecode | Native machine code |
| Runtime | .NET CLR | JVM | None |
| Platform | Cross-platform (.NET) | Cross-platform | Platform-dependent |
| Execution speed | Fast | Fast | Fastest |

---

## 🔹 3. Memory Management

| Feature | C# | Java | C++ |
|------|----|------|-----|
| Garbage Collection | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Manual memory | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Memory safety | High | High | Low (if careless) |

---

## 🔹 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

| OOP Feature | C# | Java | C++ |
|----------|----|------|------|
| Classes & Objects | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Inheritance | Single + interfaces | Single + interfaces | Multiple inheritance |
| Interfaces | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (abstract classes instead) |
| Polymorphism | Strong | Strong | Strong |
| Abstract classes | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

> ⚠ C++ multiple inheritance can increase complexity  
> ✔ C# and Java avoid the diamond problem
